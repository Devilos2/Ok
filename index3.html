    <h1>Using Quotation and Citation Tags in HTML
    </h1>
    <p>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>
    <blockquote>"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving."</blockquote>
    <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say:</p>
    <q>To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</q>
    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <i>Albert Einstein.</i> </p>

    <p>n literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example, if you're referencing a famous work
        like <i>Pride and Prejudice</i><br>this is a citation tag. by Jane Austen, you should always include the
        author's name to give proper credit.
    </p>
    <p>Another classic example can be seen in <i> Romeo and Juliet</i>
        <br>this is a citation tag.

        by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy intertwine to create a timeless story.
